Easily add your VidLive widgets in WordPress. VidLive is the easiest way to automatically stream “Currently Live" Facebook or YouTube video from your website. Add our embed code once and you are done!

== Description ==
VidLive allows you to embed your Facebook and YouTube Live videos onto your website automatically. No more updating your live embed code every time you go live. Just embed your VidLive widget once, and you are done.

Now you can use the official VidLive WordPress plugin to connect to your VidLive account and make it even easier to place your Facebook and YouTube Live videos just where you want them. Once connected, your widgets will be assigned a WordPress short code that can be placed almost anywhere on your website. If you don’t already have a VidLive account, go to VidLive.co to register.
